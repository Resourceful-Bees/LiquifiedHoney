This is a simple minecraft mod which adds a mixin that lets vanilla honey blocks melt into a liquid when placed near heat sources.
The melting process functions just like Ice Blocks do.
In ultra warm environments like the Nether, honey blocks will also melt regardless of a heat source.
When the mod is installed alongside Resourceful Bees, the honey from that mod will be used instead.
Honey Blocks won't melt when near heat sources inside the Bumblezone Dimension if that mod is installed.
